      <p><b>{{ domain_data.styled_domain }}</b> is a free interactive {{ domain_data.language_uppercase }} tutorial - one of the Interactive Tutorials websites.</p>
      <p>Interactive Tutorials is a personal project of <a href="https://github.com/ronreiter">mine</a> aimed at making everyone in the world be able to
            learn how to code for free. The servers used to run the tutorials and the time invested in writing tutorials is funded through ads.</p>

      <p>The vision is to teach coding within the browser using short and effective exercises. By running actual code directly from the web browser,
          students are able to try out coding without installing and executing it locally, which can be hard and redundant for the purpose of learning how to code.
          This creates a more efficient learning process, because students focus on learning instead of setting up coding environments.</p>

      <p>This website and its content may be used freely and without charge, and it will always be free.</p>

      <p>For any comments and suggestions, please send your feedback to <a href="mailto:{{ domain_data.support_email }}">{{ domain_data.support_email }}</a>.</p>

      <p>To contribute tutorials, please fork <a href="https://github.com/ronreiter/interactive-tutorials">this repository</a> and help with writing tutorials or translating them to different languages.</p>
