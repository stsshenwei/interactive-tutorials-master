List Comprehensions is a very powerful tool, which creates a new list based on another list, in a single, readable line.

For example, let's say we need to create a list of integers which specify the length of each word in a certain sentence, but only if the word is not the word "the".

    sentence = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
    words = sentence.split()
    word_lengths = []
    for word in words:
          if word != "the":
              word_lengths.append(len(word))
    print(words)
    print(word_lengths)

Using a list comprehension, we could simplify this process to this notation:

    sentence = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
    words = sentence.split()
    word_lengths = [len(word) for word in words if word != "the"]
    print(words)
    print(word_lengths)

Exercise
--------

Using a list comprehension, create a new list called "newlist" out of the list "numbers", which contains only the positive numbers from the list, as integers.

Tutorial Code
-------------
numbers = [34.6, -203.4, 44.9, 68.3, -12.2, 44.6, 12.7]
newlist = []
print(newlist)

Expected Output
---------------

test_output_contains("[34, 44, 68, 44, 12]")
success_msg("Very nice!")

Solution
--------
numbers = [34.6, -203.4, 44.9, 68.3, -12.2, 44.6, 12.7]
newlist = [int(x) for x in numbers if x > 0]
print(newlist)
